# Tabula Rasa Doom :godmode:
An implementation of deep Q-learning neural network playing ViZDoom that uses TF Eager Execution.

This project was completed during [CodeJam 2018 at McGill University](https://codejam.mcgilleus.ca).

# Description

# Tools and frameworks used

- [Deep Q learning with Doom](https://github.com/simoninithomas/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/blob/master/Deep%20Q%20Learning/Doom/Deep%20Q%20learning%20with%20Doom.ipynb) article and notebook by [@simoninithomas](https://github.com/simoninithomas) was used heavily as a guide.
- [Tensorflow Eager Execution](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager) was used to re-write the deep learning model and training procedure in order to make them easier to understand and improve performance.
- [ViZDoom](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom)
